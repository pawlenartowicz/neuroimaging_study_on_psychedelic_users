## Abstract

**Background:** Contemporary research implies that psychedelics induce notable neurophysiological changes, some lasting weeks to months after a single dose. However, most evidence derives from acute administration studies, and only limited short-term follow-ups. Long-term naturalistic psychedelic users remain critically underexamined, yet may exhibit distinct neurobiological profiles that could inform our understanding of persistent alterations following repeated exposure.

**Methods:** We recorded resting-state EEG in 57 long-term psychedelic users (abstinent ≥30 days) and 49 matched non-users across two independent sites under eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. We analyzed oscillatory power, signal complexity, and source-localized effective connectivity, focusing on five common frequency bands and regions comprising the: Default Mode, Salience and Central Executive Networks. Statistical analyses included linear mixed-effects models for power and complexity and a rank-based analytical method with ordinary least squares regression and randomization inference for effective connectivity.

**Results:** Contrary to hypotheses, we observed predominantly null findings. No significant group effects emerged for oscillatory power. Complexity exhibited lower values in users, only in the eyes-open condition. Effective connectivity revealed no alterations of within- or between-network connections. Exploratory analyses identified some isolated small effects, but none survived multiple comparisons correction.

**Conclusions:** Long-term naturalistic psychedelic users showed largely non-significant differences in oscillatory power, complexity, and network connectivity patterns — any of the effects commonly observed in acute administration studies. These findings warrant some considerations: whether psychedelics' neurophysiological signatures persist during abstinence regardless of repeated prior use, or whether such effects are the reflection of homeostatic receptor adaptation, individual variability, or impacting environmental factors. The subtle or incongruous effects we observed underscore the demand for methodological pluralism and careful attention to temporal and contextual variables in future research. Replication studies, more trials accommodating ecologically valid populations and larger samples will be essential to advancing the emerging field of psychedelic neuroscience.
